# Catch up!

## What did you think of the Rails week

- Liked independence of the week
- Answer cheatsheet after submission +1
- Sleep is nice
- Lonely +2
- Version was very old, too old ?
- Struggled with the dark magic of Rails
- No pair-programming (maybe add a reminder to group up if they want)
- Liked the Ruby / Rails dark magic side
- Rails breakout ++++

## What is still mystifying ?

- Routing ?
- Render
- Model / DB relation

GET /posts
POST /posts
PUT /posts/:post_id
DELETE /posts/:post_id

```jsx
  axios.post("/posts", {data:{title:..., description:...}})
```
